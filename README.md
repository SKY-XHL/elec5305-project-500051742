# A Comparative Study of Audio Feature Representations for Environmental Sound Classification

## Research Question

How do MFCC and Log-Mel feature representations compare in accuracy, macro-F1 and computational cost on ESC-50 when evaluated using the same RBF-SVM pipeline?

## Project Overview

This ELEC5305 research project investigates how different audio feature representations influence environmental sound classification performance. The project will compare commonly used representations under a controlled classification pipeline to examine their effectiveness and computational requirements.

## Dataset

The project will use the ESC-50 dataset, a publicly available benchmark containing 2,000 five-second environmental audio recordings across 50 sound classes.

Official dataset repository:

https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50

The dataset will not be stored in this repository. Instructions for downloading and preparing the dataset will be provided separately.

## Proposed Feature Representations

The initial comparison will include:

- Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)
- Log-Mel spectrogram features
- Handcrafted spectral features, if time permits

## Proposed Methodology

The audio recordings will be processed using a consistent preprocessing pipeline. Each feature representation will be evaluated using the same classification method to reduce the influence of unrelated model differences.

The initial classifier will be a Support Vector Machine with a radial basis function kernel. Evaluation will follow the official five-fold structure provided by ESC-50.

## Evaluation Metrics

The proposed evaluation metrics include:

- Classification accuracy
- Macro-F1 score
- Confusion matrix
- Feature extraction time
- Model training and inference time

## Tools

The project is expected to use:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Librosa
- NumPy and Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
